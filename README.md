This repository contains a C code example that illustrates a potential issue with pointer manipulation. The bug.c file demonstrates incorrect pointer usage, which can lead to unpredictable results depending on the system's memory layout and compiler optimization. The bugSolution.c file presents a corrected version of the code that addresses the issue. This example is designed for educational purposes to help understand and avoid such errors during C development.
